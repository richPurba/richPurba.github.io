# Wuff....
It's a been a blasting, counter-productive, scary year. I have been working in Groningen, a beautiful city in the northern part of The Netherlands. I accepted a consulting job in IT with Accenture as an Analyst and i've been very happy about how the company is excellent at bringing ethical conducts at everything they do. I was torn apart by previous experience at a start-up, where i experienced many racial slurs and jokes about my (Asian) ethnicity from a caucasian person. And my introverted reaction was even more embarassing since i just laughed it away as that jokes never happened. 
After my graduation from TU Deflt - a graduation that i was afraid not to have, but i will put it in another story - i realized that the oil price went to the one of the lowest point in the past 1-2 decades. I couldn't find any job. I just graduated with a somewhat 4k euros debt due to the extended period of time for my thesis and 60k euro debt from Desa Ternak ( a microfinance start-up that me and my friends started by died due to an absolutely unexpected event. Yes, the capital owner insisted for us to return the money as if he didn't share the risk of investment). 
I was in a state of psychological turmoil, couldn't even get any rest and proper social live. It was a nightmare. Now that i have to face the potential of losing my job. 

## Chargeability...
What i like about Accenture is that the company provides an environment of real business or capitalism: make money or die (not literally, but that's the sense you got to have in order to thrive.). We are pushed to get ourselves a project and being chargeable: every seconds is money. I like that concept. It's more real than an idea to work in a government body, where the government keeps your job security and you don't have to worry about it. 
I was hired in a oil and gas team where we are selling service to implement some Accounting software for hydrocarbon. It was okay in the first 3 months, until i realized that they lost the deal because of the lukewarm attitude from a third-world country government customer. Ever since, i have been asked to find new project and it has been really hard. The first is because of my domain (oil and gas) has very limited project opportunities. The fact that i received a contract for this job was already a miracle. So I tried to get a job in a Gas company in Groningen, but they require me to speak Dutch. The sad thing about this was because i signed the contract with Accenture because they promised me to get Dutch course. But when i get to the Business Unit, they didn't have enough money to train me Dutch. Sad right? So I despised this condition.

## Move On
So then I changed my strategy. Take a look at the market and see which skills are actually commoditized. I have seen programming has been really 'affordable' in the market. You don't have to have a degree in it, but to be a really good programmer, you have to have good CS background. So i figure it's a cheap entry to the market. So i have been studying Java and SQL a lot.
Although it sounds simple, time is actually my enemy. I have to find a project a.s.a.p, but at the same time i need to build up my skills such that i can get the project. It's been tough.
I also hate when i am in an interview and Project Manager starts asking me too many technical questions and i become anxious and start to panick. It was not pleasant!

## Christmas Gift
My boss called me and told me that if i couldn't find any project by January, they have to let me go. It was devastating Christmas. I called my girlfriend and told her about the bad news. I couldn't sleep that night and worriness killed me badly. I actually had this similar experience when i was doing my thesis at TU Delft. I remember that i drank a bottle of wine to knock off my anxious brain because i needed to rest and to wake up the next morning to do my part-time job (delivering news paper). This was the time that i truly believe that she loves me genuinely. I told her that it's going to be a sleepless night for me again. And she said to keep the Skype on all night and she can see me when i am awake. Such a glorious memory of true love. I then packed my luggage and took a bus to Czech Republic to meet my dear girlfriend and to celebrate Christmas there.
I dropped off the bus and kissed her with so much pain.
A couple days later, i received an email for an interview for a project. I read that email and i couldn't believe it. This was my necessity. This was my last chance. I prepared and we went to the university to get a proper wifi. And praise the Lord that i received that project! It was a gift of Christmas 2016. Thank you Jesus!

## Strategy
This is where i decided to focus on the skills of programming to pivot my career and leave oil-and-gas. This is partly true because i was kind of threaten by Desa Ternak's investor to prevent me to get a job because he is a prominent figure in oil and gas industry in Indonesia.
