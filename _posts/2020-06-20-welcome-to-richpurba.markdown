Hi there.
It's been a while since i explain myself on the internet. 7 years ago, i was an avid writer on Facebook, literally writing all of my thoughts on it. But i am thinking to use a more free, unrestricted opinions like blogging. 
I've been using github for a while and didn't know that ```pages``` is a cool feature on github. I literally can write anything and deploy on the internet for free. Thanks github!
