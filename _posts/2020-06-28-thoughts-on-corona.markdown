# A Difficult time

This last decade has been a bull market. Tons of investment has been poured to many startups or unicorns and the world sees a skyless, limitless optimism about the future. An outlook of opportunities, prosperity, confidence, and goodness.  Until corona crisis arrives...

## A Reminder of Hume’s Skepticism
You don’t have to know David Hume but his thinking on past, regular events and how we extrapolate to the future has been very influential in Statistics, Econometrics, and the likes. He wages

> That the sun will not rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise.

No less intelligible... I have been very much influenced by this kind of skepticism, especially by the work of Naseem Taleb’s Black Swan (you don’t have to know about him again). The basic idea about these thoughts is that when you have an inductive thinking or propositions (e.g. The world will be much better; Everything will be alright; market price is increasing; etc.) , this is where you have to employ skepticism in your premises. You really can’t expect the sun to rise again tomorrow until you have a good cosmological model (i.e your premises which Hume didn’t have back then) about it such that the universe provides you that probability or likelihood. Notice the word likelihood. 

# Likelihood would make you less arrogant
Certainty is a very hard concept in history of thoughts. In mathematics, you maybe have heard this axioms of certainty all the time. 1 + 1 = 2; that is certain. Once you accept Peano Axioms, which is the fundamental principles to make arithmetics work, then you get ‘certainty’ such that an addition of a number with 1 will give you the next natural number in the sequence. Precise. 
Of course this whole enterprise of certainty was put into a deep abyss after Gödel's incompleteness theorems was discovered by the famed Kurt Godel, a logician that proved the paradox of any consistent formal system will never be incomplete: there is always a statement that can neither proved or disproved by the system. It was a nuclear bomb to David Hilbert (please don’t google all these names, don’t worry about them). How  could it be?
 *This sentence is not true* If the proposition is true then it’s false; if it’s false then the statement then it’s actually true. Paradox. 
Math, at the fundamental level, contains this kind of paradox. Uncertainty is essential to Life. Nasseem Taleb noticed this in Financial market: people use all this Gaussian probability and sell them as if it’s made from Peano Axioms, as if they are certain. I saw a video on social media about a pyramid-like structure which has many equidistant small pins. When the guy drops small balls into it, the balls reach the bottom and after some time the balls form a bell curve, the famous gaussian structure. But Carl Gauss discovered the math not to make certain predictions about random events: he knew that random events, by definition, *unpredictable*. And all investment bankers utilize these probability models as if they are certain.  

# Don’t be too optimistic
The world has been in peace for about 80 years since world war II. The longest time without war in the history of humanity. We cannot expect that tomorrow will always be good.
