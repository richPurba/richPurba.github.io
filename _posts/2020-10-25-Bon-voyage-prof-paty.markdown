# Samuel Paty
It saddens and angers me when i hear some cutting-throat jihadist running around and intimidating the peace of humanity. This time a history teacher was killed by a Russian-born Jihadist in Paris. The same, recurring theme: Charlie Hebdo. I can't help but to think how barbaric this act, yet very sad. No one can actually do anything to prevent it. However, how proud i am to see France inaugurate this dead man as a hero. More: people marched to the street to protest against this blood thirst Jihadist that only knows how to react when anyone insult their [sacred prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Muhammad) instead of a civil discourse. It's a worldview that should be challenged, especially when they put sacredness as a towering constable to dictate who is conducting supposed blasphemy or not. Is this some kind of North Korean religion or actually a Communist religion ? <br/>
