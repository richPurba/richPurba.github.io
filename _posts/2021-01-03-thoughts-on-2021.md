# Housing Market in Netherlands
We've been searching for a house in the Netherlands. It's a crappy market and the speculation for winning a house is super lofty. Imagine that for a bidding, you could expect that the seller expects you to pay from 10% to 27% of the asking price. That's about 10k to 50k if the asking price is around 200-250k. This is madness. You basically have to dig deeper in your own pocket to have your own house.
