This is a private blog of Richard Purba. I have been thinking to write my thoughts and thinking on the web.
I am full-stack developer by profession, love entrepreneurship/business/technology and making a better future, a husband at home (married to a beautiful Czech lady), follower of (historical) Christ at heart, thinker by nature, introvert in action, passionate in people, futuristic in hoping, and more..

My personal thoughts could be described as that which that follows what is real. I have been fascinated by the search of Truth.

## Background
Back in college in Indonesia, i never really use my critical thinking to follow what is true. I was very driven by my uncontrolled emotion and societal expectation. One of the clear example i still remember is that i really liked computer simulation. And i had a course on that in my bachelor degree. Even though i got an A on that subject, i never really understood what it was. After finsihing my degree, i didn't quite understand yet but i really hate to use a software that does that thing for me. If you are coming from Petroleum Engineering, you might have heard softwares like Eclipse (Black Oil), CMG, Petrel, and other Material Balance softwares. I never really liked those softwares because to me it felt like a magic blacbox: you just put in something, and some output, no matter what, you would get some interesting scenarios. Even though i was amazed by the result and all the graphical results on the outcomes, i never really understood a thing about that black box is doing!
So i begun my journey to search the Truth. 
I ended up following a course in Math department in <a href="http://www.math.itb.ac.id/" target="_blank">Math Department</a> (by the way, i went to Petroleum Engineering in the same univesity). I attended a course from a professor from Universitat Koblenz-Landau Germany and i was fascinate by his teaching about finite difference and finite volume and how to use these two mathematical techniques for solving an analytical mathematical problems. I realized that all those graphical outcomes from the softwares i mentioned earlier is actually a matrix solution to all these analytical problems! I was so amazed by left confused because all of these mathematical constructs left me unguarded by all the assumptions: all of these techniques don't guarantee that you can actually simulate the real world subsurface phenomenon (hence the word simulate!). We can't never really get into the real actual fluid movement, subsurface characteristics, and etc. 

## Delft
I never wanted to go to Europe, well especially Holland. I always wanted to go to California and jump into all these very interesting stories of startups in Silicon Valley. But i have to keep my self in touch with reality and consider all the possibilites. I then went to Delft after all rejections from all other universities in the US. With a very limited resources (financially speaking), i had to work parttime and study efficiently. The campus is really beautiful and the university is actually very famous in the world. You'll notice that the Aerospace Engineering, Applied Physics, and Architecture are some of the top 1% departments in the world. (I honestly don't like these rankings because the metrics cannot be really quantifiable. So don't really go for any university because of these metrics! ).
This is the time that i actually learned by myself. I didn't study to get some grades but i studied to understand what is actually true. 

### The Truth
