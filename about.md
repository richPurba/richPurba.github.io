# richpurba
> This is a private blog of Richard Purba. Do you really want to read my mind? <br/> 

## Dat ben ik!
I am full-stack developer by profession, love entrepreneurship/business/technology and making a better future, a husband at home (married to a beautiful Czech lady), follower of (historical) Christ at heart, thinker by nature, introvert in action, passionate in people, futuristic in hoping, and more. <br/>\
Yes i live in The Netherlands: a small country where people speak Dutch (not me tho!).

## Thinking
I put all of my (relevant) thoughts and plans here in this blog. Feel free to reach me out to discuss more. See Footer of the page. 

## Management and Programming
I'll be putting some of my past experience in Consulting world. I've been a polygot programmer (SQL to Java) and interested very much in distributed System. The recent technology i have been fascinated about is Blockchain. <br/>
I also love people and human nature (how broken and beautiful humanity at the same time). Partly received this revelation from (Christian) Evangelist and Holy Bible.
