This is a private blog of Richard Purba. <br/>
I am full-stack developer by profession, love entrepreneurship/business/technology and making a better future, a husband at home (married to a beautiful Czech lady), follower of (historical) Christ at heart, thinker by nature, introvert in action, passionate in people, futuristic in hoping, and more..

My personal thoughts could be described as that which that follows what is real. I am fascinated by the search of Truth.
