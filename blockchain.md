# State Machine Replication
What a name! I never studied computer science, but after i jumped myself in as a Java programmer, i have seen a consistent problem in all of my past projects: how do we keep all different applcations consistently sharing the same information when the state changes from one to the other state. This might be trivial question, but the impact is quite serious in real world project.
The seminal paper of [Leslie Lamport](https://web.archive.org/web/20170123205550/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf) formalizes this consistency problem as Byzantine Fault Tolerant
